//Mixins allow you to define styles that can be re-used throughout your stylesheet

//Here I have created a simple mixin called 'btnHover' (you can name them anything you want) which declares a transition and a hover event

//I have also passed in the '$color' and '$time' parameters (you can name them anything you want) which I can use to declare unique values when I include my mixins elsewhere

@mixin btnHover($color, $time){
    transition: all $time linear;
    &:hover{
        background-color: $color;
    }
}
